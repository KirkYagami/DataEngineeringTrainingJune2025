## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

For students who finish early or want extra challenges:

1. **Web Interface**: Convert to Flask web application
2. **Database Integration**: Use SQLite instead of CSV files
3. **Multi-Currency Support**: Handle different currencies with conversion
4. **Mobile Export**: Generate mobile-friendly reports
5. **API Integration**: Connect to bank APIs for automatic transaction import

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Date Handling**: Use proper date objects, handle different formats
2. **Float Precision**: Use decimal module for accurate money calculations
3. **File Operations**: Always handle file not found exceptions
4. **Data Validation**: Don't trust user input, validate everything
5. **Memory Management**: Don't load massive CSV files into memory at once
