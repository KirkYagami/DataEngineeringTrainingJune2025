# Project 1: Hangman Game üéØ

## Overview
Build a complete Hangman game in Python that demonstrates your understanding of core programming concepts including data structures, control flow, functions, file handling, and object-oriented programming.

## Difficulty Level
**Beginner to Intermediate** | **Estimated Time: 8-12 hours**

---

## Problem Statement

Create a console-based Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. The game should be engaging, user-friendly, and demonstrate clean code practices.

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Basic Game Mechanics
- Display the word as underscores (`_ _ _ _`) initially
- Accept single letter guesses from the player
- Reveal correctly guessed letters in their positions
- Track and display incorrect guesses
- Limit incorrect guesses (typically 6-7 attempts)
- Determine win/loss conditions

#### 2. User Interface
- Clear, formatted display of game state
- Visual representation of hangman (ASCII art) that updates with wrong guesses
- Display of guessed letters (both correct and incorrect)
- Remaining attempts counter
- Input validation and error handling

#### 3. Word Management
- Minimum word list of 50+ words stored in a separate file (`words.txt`)
- Random word selection for each game
- Support for words of varying lengths (4-12 characters)
- Case-insensitive gameplay

## Implementation Guidelines

### Suggested Program Structure

```python
def load_words(filename):
    """Load words from file and return as list"""
    pass

def choose_random_word(word_list):
    """Select random word from list"""
    pass

def display_hangman(wrong_count):
    """Display ASCII hangman based on wrong guess count"""
    pass

def display_game_state(word, guessed_letters, wrong_letters, wrong_count):
    """Display current game state to user"""
    pass

def get_player_guess(guessed_letters):
    """Get and validate player's letter guess"""
    pass

def check_game_over(word, guessed_letters, wrong_count, max_wrong):
    """Check if game is won or lost"""
    pass

def play_hangman():
    """Main game function"""
    pass

def main():
    """Main program entry point"""
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Required Files Structure
```
hangman_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hangman.py          # Main game file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ words.txt          # Word list file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Project documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hangman_art.py     # ASCII art (optional separate file)
```

## Sample Game Flow

```
=== HANGMAN GAME ===

Word: _ _ _ _ _ _
Wrong letters: 
Attempts remaining: 6

  +---+
  |   |
      |
      |
      |
      |
=========

Enter a letter: p

Good guess!

Word: P _ _ _ _ _
Wrong letters: 
Attempts remaining: 6

Enter a letter: x

Wrong letter!

Word: P _ _ _ _ _
Wrong letters: X
Attempts remaining: 5

  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
      |
      |
      |
=========

Enter a letter: y

Good guess!

Word: P Y _ _ _ _
Wrong letters: X
Attempts remaining: 5

# ... game continues until win or loss
```

## Testing Checklist

Ensure your implementation handles these scenarios:

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Game loads word list successfully
- [ ] Random word selection works
- [ ] Correct letters are revealed in proper positions
- [ ] Incorrect letters are tracked separately
- [ ] Game ends when word is complete
- [ ] Game ends when max wrong guesses reached

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Duplicate letter guesses are handled appropriately
- [ ] Invalid input (numbers, symbols, multiple letters)
- [ ] Empty input handling
- [ ] Case insensitivity (A and a treated the same)
- [ ] Words with repeated letters display correctly

### User Experience
- [ ] Clear instructions provided
- [ ] Game state is always visible and understandable
- [ ] Hangman ASCII art displays correctly
- [ ] Win/loss messages are clear

## Getting Started Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic word display and letter guessing
2. **Test Frequently**: Test each function as you write it
3. **Use Print Statements**: Debug by printing variable values
4. **Handle One Thing at a Time**: Don't try to implement everything at once
5. **Read Error Messages**: Python's error messages are helpful for debugging

## Academic Integrity
This project should be completed individually. While you may discuss general approaches with classmates, the code you submit must be your own work. Plagiarism will result in a failing grade.

**Good luck, and happy coding! üêç**
